Instruction to run codes:
1) data folder should contain CIFAR-10 dataset downloaded from <LINK>
2) run FClayer.py, Relu.py, Softmax.py, neuralnet.py, CEloss.py 
3) run training_2.py for two-class classification using layers implemented from scratch
4) run training_5.py for five-class classification using layers implemented from scratch
5) run cnn_training_2.py for two-class classification using torch


-- FClayer.py contains code for implementation of custom ANN
-- Relu.py contains code for implementation of custom relu func.
-- Softmax.py contains code for implementation of custom Softmax func.
-- CEloss.py contains code for implementation of custom Cross Entropy func.
-- neuralnet.py contains architechture of the model
